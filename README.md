# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# CHICKENJACK
# Mixture of a game of Chicken and Blackjack
# As many players as you want!
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# General info: start at 0, try to get as close to 21 as possible 
# without crossing over to 22 (or higher number)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Multiplayer mode: each player takes turns making a choice--do 
# they take an increment or do they chicken out?
# If they chicken out, the other players should take increments until
# they get a higher number than the chicken(s).
# If a player's total is less than or equal to 21, they can win if they
# end up with the highest score!
# If they go over, though, they lose and the players with scores of
# 21 or less win!
# Note: ties are possible!
